# Show My PR's

## Motivation

I wanted to create an `Open Source` section on [my website](https://karanjthakkar.com) to showcase some of the contributions that I have done over the years. Finding the PR's, sorting them, grouping them was a big pain. I couldnt't find any service that did this already. 


## Features

1. See all your Pull Requests grouped by repositories: `/user/<username>`
2. Add `?response_type=json` to consume the json response directly


## Coming Next

- [ ] Sorting based on the stars/forks that a repository has
- [ ] Response caching for faster profile loads
- [ ] Filters based on PR state: Open/Merged/Closed
